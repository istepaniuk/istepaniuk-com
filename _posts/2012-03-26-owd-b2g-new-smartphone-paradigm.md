  <p>
    Last weekend on the <a href="http://codemotion.es/">Codemotion</a> Madrid, I had the chance to play around with one of the handful of prototype smartphones in the world running the <em>Open Web Device</em> (<em>OWD</em>) platform, based on Mozilla&#8217;s Boot2Gecko (<em>B2G</em>) project.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The phone is a Qualcom prototype running at just 600MHz, and as you can see in the picture, it looks like a smartphone (surprise!). The launcher interface feels very smooth, and some of the applications icons you see are somewhat-functional mocks (ie: facebook), others are just the real thing, web applications running on a web based phone, I call that <em>native</em>! and that&#8217;s the interesting part from the developer point of view.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can use the same technologies they we already know, to build web applications that will run in this phone as native Apps, but can also run on <em>Android</em> or <em>iOS</em> as non-native HTML5 Apps. If this platform successfully replaces <em>feature-phone</em> devices in the lower-end market, we will eventually have access to <strong>millions of potential new users.</strong>

The first thing that came to my mind during my short test call was &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m calling you from a web browser!&#8221;. You can also see it working on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2NvLmmhOM8" target="_blank">this video</a>.

  <p>
    The strong point of the B2G sales pitch is the price. With hardware component cost of around $50 USD, this platform could represent a complete paradigm shift within the mobile device arena, and in Brendan Eich&#8217;s words, &#8220;<em>the opportunity to convert a large part of the world from  feature-phones [low-end] to smartphones</em>&#8221;
