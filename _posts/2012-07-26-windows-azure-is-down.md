Since 11:09 AM UTC today, the compute nodes in  the Windows Azure Platform are not responding for the West-Europe region.

According to Microsoft, they [&#8230;] *are experiencing an availability issue in the West Europe sub-region, which impacts access to hosted services in this region.* [&#8230;]

No technical explanation is provided on the site whatsoever.

More info at the [Azure dashboard][1]

**UPDATE:**  
Microsoft Reports that at 1:33 PM UTC &#8220;*The issue has been addressed&#8221;.*

This is the second major outage in 2012 for the Windows Azure cloud as it was hit by downtime on Feb. 29th because of the &#8220;Leap Day&#8221; incident, triggered by a security certificate date with 29th Feb. on a date.
