Isn't that a classic?

My name is Iván, you can read about me in the [about page][1]. This is my blog, it's not my first blog, but it's the first one exclusively related to my work as a software developer. Its purpose it to share knowledge, thoughts and experiences. To teach, and  to learn from the feedback. I also hope that it will be a link between myself and the software developer community.

I plan that most of the articles will be written in English. However, I live in Spain and my native language is Spanish, so you could expect some article in Spanish as well.

I'd like to thank my colleague [Carlos Blé][2] for (among many other things) convincing me to stop thinking about starting a technical blog and start actually having one.
