![Iván Stepaniuk](/img/ivan-stepaniuk.jpg)

I am a software developer with a strong background in electronics and telecommunications. I have been writing software for more than fifteen years, in a wide variety of languages and platforms ranging  from Assembler to JavaScript and from 8bit micro-controllers to large web applications.

Currently working at [The Cloakroom](http://www.thecloakroom.com) I enjoy the challenge of an ambitious project and a great team where I can both teach and learn new things every day.

I advocate the [Software Craftmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and [Agile Manifesto][1], this has been a great motivation and helped me reinventing myself as a better developer that makes better software.
