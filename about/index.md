![Iván Stepaniuk](/img/ivan-stepaniuk.jpg)

I have been creating software for more than fifteen years in a wide variety of stacks, languages and platforms. I currently work at [The Cloakroom](http://www.thecloakroom.com) in Amsterdam, where I enjoy the challenge of an ambitious project, and the possibility to teach and learn new things every day in a great team.

I advocate the [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and [Agile Manifesto][1], this has been a great motivation and helps me to continuously reinvent myself as a better developer that makes better quality software.
