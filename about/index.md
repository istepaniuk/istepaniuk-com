![Iván Stepaniuk](/img/ivan-stepaniuk.jpg)

I have been creating software for over twenty years in a wide variety of stacks, languages and platforms. 
I am based in Amsterdam and work as an independent consultant and technical coach at [Stepaniuk](https://stepaniuk.nl) where I help my clients move to the next level.

I advocate the [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and [Agile][1] manifestos. These, together with [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices, have been a great source of motivation and help me continuously reinvent myself as a better developer that makes better quality software.
