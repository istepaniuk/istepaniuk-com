I am not actively looking for a new job at the moment. Nonetheless, **thank you** very much for offering me or thinking about me for a position.

I am always open for new opportunities, and it is always good to keep an eye on our industry's needs. I receive many requests or proposals like yours every week. Unfortunately, I could not possibly answer them all personally. That is why I have created this page on my site, I hope you do not mind.

Even if I were actively searching for a new challenge, there are a couple of things I need to know **upfront**, before actually considering it. Because this is **non-negotiable**, I do not deal with external recruiters, headhunters or employment agencies of any sort. Understandably, they cannot provide this information. I am sorry.

The list may seem a bit extensive, but after all, these are basic things I would look for if I was applying for a position myself.

#### Basic company details

* Mission, vision, purpose, market/customers.
* The company founders, key people, who they are & what drives them.

#### Is there a dev team already?

* Who are the key team members
* What have they done?
* What are their team practices and values?

Furthermore, if you are an internal recruiter or HR person and can actually point or link to this essential information, note that there are a couple of industries and markets I rather not write software for, ever:

* Weapon, Military & Defense
* Most Coal, Oil & Gas
* Financial Services
* High Speed Trading
* Investment Banking
* Most Adult Entertainment
* Cassinos & Gambling
* Most Health Insurance
* Digital Rights Management
* Religious Organizations

# Thanks for understanding!
